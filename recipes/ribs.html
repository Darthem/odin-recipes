        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I ADORE this flavor combination! Sweet and heat, especially with
             an Asian twist, is one of my favorites. Combine that with sticky 
             and caramelized on these fall-off-the-bone, tender ribs and you 
             have absolute perfection.

        <p>
            One thing I really like about this rib method, other then the fact 
            that even my pickiest child will eat them, is that it is basically 
            a set-it and forget-it type of recipe. No babysitting required.

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt - course</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Sticky Asian Sauce</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>    
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger, fresh grated</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>On the back of the rack of ribs, score the white membrane in a
                one inch diagonal pattern using a sharp knife or completely 
                remove the white membrane.</li>
            <li>Stir the brown sugar rib rub ingredients together in a small 
                bowl. Pat the rub mixture over the front and back of the slab 
                of ribs.</li>
            <li>Place the ribs meat side up on a baking sheet that has been 
                greased or lined with foil or parchment. Cover tightly with 
                foil.</li>
            <li>Bake the covered ribs for 2 - 2.5 hours. Test for tenderness 
                and if the meat is easily pulling away from the bone. Cook for 
                an additional half an hour if needed.</li>
            <li>Place the Sticky Asian Sauce ingredients in a small sauce pan. 
                Bring to a low boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Let the sauce 
                cool to thicken.</li>
            <li>When desired rib tenderness is reached, remove the foil.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven to broil. Brush the ribs with the Sticky Asian 
                Sauce. Broil for 2-3 minutes and then brush with sauce again. 
                Broil an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce starts to 
                caramelize.</li>
            <li>Garnish with any left over sauce, sesame seeds, and sliced green
                onions.</li>
        </ol>
