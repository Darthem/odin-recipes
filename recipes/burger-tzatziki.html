            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried lemon peel, optional</li>

            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground lamb 
                (or a combination of beef and lamb)</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>To serve:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Crumbled feta</li>
            <li>Red onion</li>
            <li>Tzatziki sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the tzatziki:</strong><br>
                Salt the cucumber slices with about 1/2 teaspoon salt 
                and place in a sieve over a bowl to drain. Refrigerate 
                for 1 hour or up to 24 hours, occasionally turning 
                cucumbers. (If you need to prepare the tzatziki right 
                away, salt the cucumbers for just 10 minutes, then 
                squeeze out excess moisture with a clean tea towel.)<br>
                In a large bowl, mix cucumbers, yogurt, herbs, vinegar,
                and garlic. Stir to combine. Taste and season with salt
                if needed.<br>
                This step can be done up to 3 days before serving.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Combine spices:</strong><br>
                Whisk together the dried onion, dried garlic, dried 
                lemon peel, dried oregano, salt, and pepper in a small
                bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Shape the lamb burgers:</strong><br>
                Sprinkle the ground lamb with 2 teaspoons of the spice 
                mix and gently work it into the meat with your finger 
                tips or a spatula; try not to over-mix the meat or 
                compact it too much as you work in the spices.<br>
                Turn the seasoned meat out on a work surface and form 
                into four (6 ounce) patties. Press a shallow dimple in
                the center of each patty to help the patties cook evenly
                and prevent them from forming domes in the middle.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Season and rest the burgers:</strong><br>
                Sprinkle additional seasoning onto both sides of the 
                patties. Rest on counter for 20 to 30 minutes to allow 
                burgers to come to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Meanwhile, prepare your grill:</strong><br>
                If you have a gas grill, preheat at high temperature for
                at least 10 minutes with the lid closed. For charcoal 
                grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it.
                When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a 
                layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill. 
                Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Heat for 5 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Grill the burgers:</strong><br>
                When your grill is ready, lightly brush the grates with 
                oil. Add the burgers and close the grill. Cook the 
                burgers to your desired doneness, flipping halfway 
                through cooking. (Cook 3 to 4 minutes on each side for 
                medium rare, or to 145Â°F.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Finish and serve:</strong><br>
                Rest your lamb burgers for 3 minutes while you toast the
                buns on the grill. Then serve immediately with tzatziki 
                sauce and other toppings.
            </li>
