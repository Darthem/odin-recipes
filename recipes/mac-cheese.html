            <li>1/2 onion sweet onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups whole or 2% milk</li>
            <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried mustard(optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>For the crispy breadcrumbs:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup breadcrumbs, such as panko</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong><br>
                Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the 
                pasta until al dente, or according to package 
                instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop
                the cooking and keep the pasta from sticking together.
                Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the onions and garlic:</strong><br>
                In a large pot over medium heat, add butter. Once the 
                butter is melted, add chopped onions and cook for a few
                minutes until they turn translucent. Then add garlic 
                and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir the flour into 
                the onion and garlic mixture and cook for a minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir in the milk, mustard and cheese:</strong><br>
                Slowly add the milk while stirring. The flour and 
                onion mixture will thicken as you add the milk.<br>
                
                Once all the milk is added, stir in the grated cheese
                and mustard. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until the cheese has melted.</li>
            <li><strong>Stir the chicken and pasta into the sauce:
                </strong><br>
                Once the cheese is melted, stir in the chicken and 
                cooked pasta. Taste and season with salt and pepper as 
                needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the breadcrumbs:</strong><br>
                Whenever you have a few spare moments while assembling 
                this pasta (like, while cooking the onions or while 
                waiting for the cheese to melt), cook the breadcrumbs.
                <br>
                Melt the butter in a small skillet over low heat. Stir 
                in the breadcrumbs until well combined. Continue to 
                stir over low heat until the breadcrumbs are browned, 3
                to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. 
                Breadcrumbs can also be toasted ahead of time and stored
                in an airtight container.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong><br>
                Ladle the cheesy chicken macaroni right out of the pot 
                when it's super creamy, and top it with crispy 
                breadcrumbs.</li>
        </ol>
